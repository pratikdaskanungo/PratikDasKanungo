I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Management, with a strong passion for web technologies. I am actively working towards becoming a Full-Stack Developer and have had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through my work with Ekeeda. While I possess foundational knowledge in Python, my primary focus is on Full-Stack Web Development.

I have developed proficiency in front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, and ReactJS, and am continually expanding my expertise. Additionally, I am experienced in deploying web projects using platforms like Heroku, Netlify, and Firebase. I am committed to broadening my technical skills and am eager to contribute to innovative web development projects.
